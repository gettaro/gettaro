## OpenAPI Syncing
- Any time a route, middleware, or payload (request or response) is added or modified, the `openapi.yml` file must be updated accordingly.
- Keep the OpenAPI spec in sync with:
  - Endpoint definitions
  - Input/output types
  - Auth requirements

## Postman Collection Syncing
- Any time a route, middleware, or payload (request or response) is added or modified, the `openapi.yml` file must be updated accordingly.
- Keep the OpenAPI spec in sync with:
  - Endpoint definitions
  - Input/output types
  - Auth requirements

## Function Documentation
- Every function must include a descriptive comment
- Comments should explain:
  - Purpose
  - Parameters
  - Return values
  - Any important side effects or assumptions

## Example Function Doc
```go
// GetUser handles the retrieval of a user by ID.
// Params:
// - c: the Gin context containing request and response
// Returns a JSON object with the user data, or an error response.
func (h *UserHandler) GetUser(c *gin.Context) { ... }
```

## Good Practices
- Use consistent and clear language
- Make it easy for other developers (and Cursor) to understand and extend the code
