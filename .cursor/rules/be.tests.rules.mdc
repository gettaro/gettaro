# Testing Rules

## Test Coverage
- [ ] Write tests for all new features
- [ ] Test both success and error cases
- [ ] Document test cases with comments

## Test Organization
- [ ] Group tests by feature/function
- [ ] Use descriptive test names
- [ ] Keep tests focused and atomic

## Test Files
- [ ] Test handlers in `backend/http/handlers/**/*.go`
- [ ] Test service logic in `backend/services/**/api/*.go`
- [ ] Use consistent test file naming

## Best Practices
- [ ] Mock external dependencies
- [ ] Use test fixtures where appropriate
- [ ] Clean up test data after tests
