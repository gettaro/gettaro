# API Response Rules

## Response Format
- [ ] Wrap all responses in a single enclosing object
- [ ] Use consistent naming for response objects

## Example Response Format
```json
{
  "user": {
    "name": "mario"
  }
}
```

## List Responses
- [ ] Always return empty arrays instead of null
- [ ] Use consistent plural naming for list responses

## Example List Response
```json
{
  "users": []
}
```

## Type Definitions
- [ ] Define response types in `http/types/{resourceName}/get_{resourceName}.go`
- [ ] Reuse types across operations (e.g., `GetUser`, `CreateUser`)
- [ ] Keep response types in sync with OpenAPI spec

## Files
- `backend/http/**/*.go`
